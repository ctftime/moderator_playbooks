*This repo is community-managed*
Here is a documentation for moderation process at CTFtime.org.

# What is a CTF and What is an Event

*CTF* is a serie of events, CTFs are managed by some *Team* (s). CTF is an aggregation key for events.
CTFs does not have specific dataframes.

*Event* is a specific event within the CTF. Event always has specific datetime frames.
Same Team can manage multiple CTFs or Events. 
Events have organizers.

# Event format
* Attack-defence
* Jeopardy
* Hack-quest

# Physical limits
* Online
* On-site

# Rule Restrictions
* Academic-only
* Single player
* Prequalified
* Othen unspecified

# What is event weight
Events can be *casual* - this type of events always have 0 weight.
Events can be *votable* - weight for event of this type is determined by voting.

Moderating CTFs
===============

In most cases after team creates a CTF and we just approve it.
Here are some non-standart cases.

# CTF does not have any relevant information like URL or description
* We reject the CTF

 # CTF has spammy description
* We reject the CTF

# CTF is created instead of Event
* We edit CTF name / slug / description so organizers will create specific event

# CTFs name already exists
Sometimes organizers forget that they created a CTF, create new teams and can not manage their CTF.
* We figure out why this happened and change CTF owners if required.

Moderating Events
=================
After team has approved CTF it can create events.
Important questions are:
* does event have relevant information for participants?
* is datetime correct?
* is event type correctly chosen?
* should the event has any weight?

# How we determine if an event should have some weight?
TBD
